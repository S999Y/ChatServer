## Getting Started

AES-Encrypted Java Chat Application:
This project is a secure, real-time chat application developed in Java using Swing for the graphical user interface. It enables multiple users to communicate over a local server (localhost) with robust AES-256 encryption securing every message. Each message sent is encrypted before transmission and decrypted upon receipt, ensuring privacy and data protection.

A key feature of this application is the integrated AES Visualizer, which provides a step-by-step graphical breakdown of the encryption and decryption process for each message. This makes the application not only functional but also educational—perfect for demonstrating how AES works in real-time communication.

✨ Features:
--Real-time chat with multiple users on localhost
--AES-256 encryption and decryption of all messages
--User-friendly GUI with modern design and theme support
--Step-by-step AES visualization window for each message
--Option to create or join a server with custom username and port

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
